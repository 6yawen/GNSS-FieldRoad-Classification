# An Integrated Framework for GNSS Trajectory Field–Road Classification with DBSCAN-Guided Augmentation and Spatiotemporal Learning
This study addresses the challenge of field–road classifica-tion in precision agriculture using GNSS trajectory data. Accurate identification of operational (field) and travel (road) points is critical for smart agriculture, land-use monitoring, and field management.
#  Journal Extensions
Compared with our ICIC 2025 conference paper “ VE-ResBiLSTM: A Deep Spatiotemporal Model for Field–Road Classification with DBSCAN-Based Data Augmentation”, the journal version achieves substantial extensions and systematic improvements in theoretical depth, methodological design, experimental analysis, and reproducibility:
