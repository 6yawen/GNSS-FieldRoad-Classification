# An Integrated Framework for GNSS Trajectory Field–Road Classification with DBSCAN-Guided Augmentation and Spatiotemporal Learning
This study addresses the challenge of field–road classifica-tion in precision agriculture using GNSS trajectory data. Accurate identification of operational (field) and travel (road) points is critical for smart agriculture, land-use monitoring, and field management.
